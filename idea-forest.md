"Forest Builder" - Gamified Visual Progress

A pomodoro app where each completed session grows a virtual tree/plant. Different project categories (study subjects, work tasks) create different plant types. Your daily forest visually
represents productivity - bigger trees for longer sessions, different species for different projects. Features include:

- Daily/weekly/monthly forest views
- Streak bonuses for consecutive days
- "Withering" effect if you break focus
- Export your forest as wallpaper/motivation

Core Mechanics

- Plant Growth Stages: Each pomodoro (25 min) grows your plant through 4 stages: seed → sprout → sapling → full tree
- Project Types = Plant Species:
  - Study subjects: Oak (Math), Pine (Science), Cherry Blossom (Languages), Willow (Literature)
  - Work projects: Bamboo (Quick tasks), Redwood (Long-term projects), Cactus (Difficult tasks)
- Daily Garden Layout: Grid system where each day shows your forest, older days fade into background "forest depth"

Visual Features

- Morning Mist: Unused time slots appear foggy, clearing as you work
- Seasonal Changes: Your forest reflects real seasons or productivity "seasons"
- Wildlife Visitors: Consistent streaks attract animals (birds after 3 days, rabbits after 7, etc.)
- Time-of-Day Lighting: Forest lighting matches when you actually worked

Motivation Elements

- Canopy Coverage: Shows overall productivity percentage
- Rare Plants: Unlock special plants for achievements (studying 100 hours, 30-day streak)
- Forest Health Score: Visual feedback if you're overworking (wilting) or maintaining balance
